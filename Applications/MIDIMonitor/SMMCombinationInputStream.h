// This class will repost these notifications from its streams (with self as object):

//	SMInputStreamDoneReadingSysExNotification
//	SMInputStreamSelectedInputSourceDisappearedNotification
//
// It will also listen to SMInputStreamSourceListChangedNotification from its streams,
// and coalesce them into a single notification (with the same name) from this object.
